        "description": "In real world applications such as autonomous driving and security surveillance, pedestrian detection is essential for ensuring safety and efficiency. These systems must perform reliably across a diverse range of conditions, from clear daylight images to lower quality visuals caused by noise, low light conditions or greyscale cameras. This project aimed to develop a pedestrian detection model using the YOLOv8 architecture, which is optimised for real-time performance and accuracy across a range of conditions.",
